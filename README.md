# M64x4LangtonsAnt

An implementation of Langton's Ant for the Minimal 64x4

Langont's ant is a cellular automata (created by Chris Langton) that works on a black and white grid. The 'ant' follows a set of rules; when landing on a white square it will turn right and move forward one step and flip the colour to black, when landing on a black square it will turn left and move forward one step and flip the colour to white.

The two simple rules produce emeregent behaviour.
